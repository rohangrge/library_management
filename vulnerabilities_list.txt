helper_functions.c:20:17: Possibly null storage name passed as non-null param:
                             scanf (..., name, ...)
  A possibly null pointer is passed as a parameter corresponding to a formal
  parameter with no /*@null@*/ annotation.  If NULL may be used for this
  parameter, add a /*@null@*/ annotation to the function parameter declaration.
  (Use -nullpass to inhibit warning)
   helper_functions.c:11:12: Storage name may become null
helper_functions.c:20:5: Return value (type int) ignored: scanf("%s", name)
  Result returned by function call is not used. If this is intended, can cast
  result to (void) to eliminate message. (Use -retvalint to inhibit warning)
helper_functions.c:22:17: Possibly null storage mno passed as non-null param:
                             scanf (..., mno, ...)
   helper_functions.c:13:11: Storage mno may become null
helper_functions.c:22:5: Return value (type int) ignored: scanf("%s", mno)
helper_functions.c:24:17: Possibly null storage email passed as non-null param:
                             scanf (..., email, ...)

helper_functions.c:54:17: Possibly null storage name passed as non-null param:
                             scanf (..., name, ...)
   helper_functions.c:47:12: Storage name may become null
helper_functions.c:54:5: Return value (type int) ignored: scanf("%s", name)
helper_functions.c:57:17: Unrecognized identifier: getch
  Identifier used in code has not been declared. (Use -unrecog to inhibit
  warning)
helper_functions.c:57:12: Operands of != have incompatible types (char, int):
                             (c = getch()) != 13
  To make char and int types equivalent, use +charint.
helper_functions.c: (in function userstruct)
helper_functions.c:93:19: Possibly null storage lfp passed as non-null param:
                             fscanf (lfp, ...)
   helper_functions.c:86:17: Storage lfp may become null
helper_functions.c:95:16: Index of possibly null pointer uarr: uarr
  A possibly null pointer is dereferenced.  Value is either the result of a
  function which may return null (in which case, code should check it is not
  null), or a global, parameter or structure field declared with the null
  qualifier. (Use -nullderef to inhibit warning)
   helper_functions.c:87:21: Storage uarr may become null
helper_functions.c:101:5: Return value (type int) ignored: fclose(lfp)
helper_functions.c:102:12: Possibly null storage uarr returned as non-null:
                              uarr
  Function returns a possibly null pointer, but is not declared using
  /*@null@*/ annotation of result.  If function may return NULL, add /*@null@*/
  annotation to the return value declaration. (Use -nullret to inhibit warning)
   helper_functions.c:87:21: Storage uarr may become null
helper_functions.c:102:12: Returned storage *uarr contains 4 undefined fields:
                              name, mno, email, passwd
  Storage derivable from a parameter, return value or global is not defined.
  Use /*@out@*/ to denote passed or returned storage which need not be defined.
  (Use -compdef to inhibit warning)

helper_functions.c:118:16: Index of possibly null pointer uarr: uarr
   helper_functions.c:108:23: Storage uarr may become null

                              fprintf (fp, ...)
   helper_functions.c:136:16: Storage fp may become null
helper_functions.c:143:12: Possibly null storage fp passed as non-null param:
                              fclose (fp)
   helper_functions.c:136:16: Storage fp may become null
helper_functions.c:143:5: Return value (type int) ignored: fclose(fp)
helper_functions.c: (in function show_avail)
helper_functions.c:161:2: Fresh storage listbooks not released before return
  A memory leak has been detected. Storage allocated locally is not released
  before the last reference to it is lost. (Use -mustfreefresh to inhibit
  warning)
   helper_functions.c:149:44: Fresh storage listbooks created
helper_functions.c:146:35: Parameter name not used
  A function parameter is not used in the body of the function. If the argument
  is needed for type compatibility or future plans, use /*@unused@*/ in the
  argument declaration. (Use -paramuse to inhibit warning)
helper_functions.c: (in function login_check)
helper_functions.c:175:26: Fresh storage cuser not released before return
   helper_functions.c:165:47: Fresh storage cuser created

   helper_functions.c:165:47: Fresh storage cuser created
helper_functions.c:186:9: Unreachable code: c += 1
  This code will never be reached on any possible execution. (Use -unreachable
  to inhibit warning)
helper_functions.c:188:2: Path with no return in function declared to return
                             int
  There is a path through a function declared to return a value on which there
  is no return statement. This means the execution may fall through without
  returning a meaningful result to the caller. (Use -noret to inhibit warning)
helper_functions.c:188:2: Fresh storage cuser not released before return
   helper_functions.c:165:47: Fresh storage cuser created

helper_functions.c:261:44: Passed storage time not completely defined (*time is
                              undefined): strcpy (..., time)
helper_functions.c:262:24: Parameter 1 (out[count].user) to function strcpy is
    declared unique but may be aliased externally by parameter 2 (name)
  A unique or only parameter may be aliased by some other parameter or visible
  global. (Use -mayaliasunique to inhibit warning)
